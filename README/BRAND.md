[BLOCK 2: BRANDING / VISUAL STYLE / UI TONE / ASSETS]

COLOR SYSTEM (LOCKED)
- Background color: #000000
- Primary brand color: #0dbb63
- Secondary brand color: #2D6CDF
- The site should not visually resemble “Hulk” (avoid clashing greens; use green primarily as an accent, not dominant fills everywhere).

LOOK + FEEL (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- Overall aesthetic: extremely professional, “premium portfolio” quality suitable for employers.
- Dark theme first, clean and modern; minimal clutter.
- Mixed audience (recruiters + hiring managers + engineers): the design must read as credible and serious immediately.
- The “game-styled” layer must exist but must NOT undermine professionalism.
  - Gamification elements must be subtle/polished rather than childish.
  - The core portfolio must stand on its own even if gamification is disabled.

LAYOUT / NAV EXPERIENCE (VISUAL-RELATED CONSTRAINTS)
- Multi-page structure is required (not a single scroll-only page).
- Homepage must clearly route to multiple career target pages.
- The UI must allow highlighting the “current main focus” topic (Cloud/AWS/Data/Data Engineering) prominently.

VISUAL COMPONENT EXPECTATIONS (GUIDANCE, NOT CODE)
- Use a consistent system for:
  - Section headers
  - Cards (projects, certifications, courses, experience)
  - Skill visuals (icons/images)
  - Buttons/CTAs (especially the contact CTA)
- Visual hierarchy must prioritize:
  1) Who I am + my current focus
  2) Top proof/projects for that focus
  3) Supporting proof (certs/courses/skills)
  4) Secondary track access (e.g., GameDev) without crowding the main storyline

ASSETS (LOCKED)
- I already have images for different skills located in `/images/`.
- The plan should assume these images will be used throughout the site (e.g., skill cards, track hero visuals, project visuals where applicable).
- The site must be structured so it’s easy to add more images later without redesigning the whole UI.

GAMIFICATION VISUAL INTEGRATION (BRANDING-RELEVANT RULES)
- Game-style UI elements that must exist and must fit the professional aesthetic:
  - Notifications/toasts (subtle)
  - A score/points HUD in the top-right (small, tasteful)
  - “Upgrades” cosmetics (e.g., tiny dog companion) that appear only after unlock
- Gamification visuals must be:
  - Optional/toggleable
  - Accessible (keyboard + reduced motion support)
  - Never blocking or distracting from core content consumption

DO-NOT-ASSUME NOTES
- If you need typography preferences, spacing style (tight vs airy), animation intensity, or inspiration sites, ask in Phase 7 instead of guessing.
