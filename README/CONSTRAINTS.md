[BLOCK 7: LOCKED DECISIONS / CONSTRAINTS ALREADY CONFIRMED]

TARGET JOB TITLES (NEXT ~6 MONTHS) (LOCKED)
- Software Engineer
- Cloud Engineer
- Software Engineer is likely the “umbrella” identity across the site (confirmed as “maybe”; do not assume it becomes a dedicated route unless I explicitly approve later).

CURRENT MAIN FOCUS (LOCKED)
- AWS / Cloud / Data / Data Engineering

TRACKS AT LAUNCH (LOCKED)
- /cloud
- /dataengineer
- /gamedev

DATA ENGINEER TRACK EMPHASIS (LOCKED)
- pipelines / ETL + SQL + orchestration

AUDIENCE (LOCKED)
- Mixed audience: recruiters + hiring managers + engineers

PRIMARY CTA / CONVERSION GOAL (LOCKED)
- The #1 action I want from employers: contact me for a job through an email form

CONTACT FORM DESTINATION + SAFETY (LOCKED)
- Destination email: lin8x.github@gmail.com
- Spam protection required (captcha and/or honeypot must be included)
- Confirmation copy required (success message after sending)

HOSTING (LOCKED)
- GitHub Pages (static hosting)
- Any form solution must be compatible with a static site approach

BRANDING (LOCKED)
- Background: #000000
- Primary: #0dbb63
- Secondary: #2D6CDF

HOMEPAGE STORYLINE PRIORITY (LOCKED)
- The homepage must prioritize the Cloud/Data engineer builder storyline (AWS/Cloud/Data focus).
- GameDev is a credible secondary track and should not create “equal-weight chaos” on the homepage.
- Track routing is the mechanism to keep the narrative clean.

ASSETS (LOCKED)
- Skill images exist in `/images/` and the site should be designed to use them.

PROCESS EXPECTATION (LOCKED INTENT)
- The bot must ask many questions (in phases) before writing the final plan or any code.
- The bot must ultimately generate and output a full `copilot-instructions.md` file.
