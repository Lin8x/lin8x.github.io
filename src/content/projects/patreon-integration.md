## Overview
Built a scalable backend system to automate Patreon reward fulfillment and user management with secure authentication and automated publishing.

## Key Achievements
- **Cloud Deployment:** Developed an AWS-hosted EC2 website using HTML, JavaScript, and Node.js, with MySQL for the database.
- **API Integration:** Utilized the Patreon API and JSON to interact with user data and determine membership status.
- **Authentication:** Implemented OAuth 2.0 for secure Patreon user login and authentication.
- **Automation:** Allowed Patreon users to input information, which was linked to a MySQL database and published to a public GitHub repository using GitHub Actions.
- **Security:** Employed an XOR cipher to encrypt data before publishing to ensure privacy and security.
